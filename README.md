# react-todo-demo
This is a simple TO DO Application in React. This is a fun project to do for beginners who are trying to learn and get their hands on React. In this application, I've used React Components, React forms, event handlers etc. It is a very easy quick application where user can Add, Edit, Delete or Clear All the Todo Items. Have Fun....
